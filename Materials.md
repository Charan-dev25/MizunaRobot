## Additional Notes

- **Wiring:** Use quality jumper wires and ensure all grounds are connected.
- **Power:** Use a high-current 5V supply for the Pi and LEDs. Motors may require a separate supply.
- **Sensors:** You can expand with more sensors (PIR, temperature, etc.) as needed.
- **Enclosure:** 3D-printed or custom chassis recommended for protection and aesthetics.
